```javascript
// Some Tailwind classes might not work as expected due to unexpected CSS specificity.
// For example, a class with high specificity might override a class with lower specificity,
// even if you intend the lower specificity class to take precedence.

// Example:
<div class="relative">
  <div class="absolute top-0 left-0 bg-red-500">
    <!-- This red div might be hidden by content inside the relative div if that content has higher specificity-->
    <p class="text-white">This text might not be visible!</p>
  </div>
</div>
